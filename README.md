# Description #

Describe DCRS is like describing the sensation of sex. But I can explain in a human-understandable way! Imagine a world when the BIOS we know and OS are merged. Then we have the DCRS. Imagine the OS we know running in a environment and only doing settings for our work ecosystem while DCRS do the advanced settings. Then we have WS.js running on DCRS. For final user the sensation is that DCRS is the BIOS and WS.js the operating system (OS). But technically DCRS is the OS and WS.js the work system (WS)!

DCRS is a achronym for Device Checker/Runtime System. This is a new concept, when operating system (DCRS) do the advanced settings and WS the basic ambient for work. DCRS for settings, WS.js for your work!

DCRS is modern, open-source and the world's first runtime environment for run [WS.js - The template Work System](https://github.com/Software-js/WS.js "Click here to know more how WS.js works and get started how make your own WS.").

When start the device, this firmware/runtime/system will do the first work like a BIOS does: verifying all device's components.

**But this is very different than a BIOS!** When finish the hardware check, this system will search for work systems installed in all connected storage devices. Then, this kernel will run an single WS installed or show an boot-selector screen for selecting WS to run from each storage device, and will run the interface of WS working as an runtime. With this, you will can easily bootoff WS A and go to WS B, with multi-WS running at the same time! This "BIOS" will can adapt the code/design for work in all possible resolutions, for an multi-device connected future. You can know more at SPECS.md file, included in this project.

Yes, this firmware is an runtime that uses interface in HTML5/CSS/JavaScript and compatible only with work systems, that compatible with the technology of this firmware.

Codes that manipulate hardware will be sent from WS to DCRS, and from DCRS to Node.js (NW.js).

DCRS will have 2 versions. You can call DCRS as a firmware (in your EFI version) or not (in its OS version). The OS version isn't hard and I can do. The EFI version is the most complex and I'll need help to do it, but will be the most modern and reliable. You can call DCRS as system/runtime/environment in any of his versions.

You can start understanding an modern OS or making your own at [this project hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/DaniellMesquita/Modern-OS).
